# BookStudy
This is supposed to be a terminal application to read online books and articles better since digital reading is harder than analog reading it will read out the book for you. (its designed for marxists.org but can be used for other sites... I hope)


# How to use

The main file is bookStudy.java so you will need to run that to start the programm

so run java bookStudy in your termindal after cd ing into the Book Study folder

I will need to make it possible for windows users to use since for some reason windows uses \ between files intead of /

# Adding a new book

Either in the opening menu select 1 new book and enter a link. This is experimental and buggy
Or you can open Data and paste your book into CurrentBook.txt and add a 0 in the last line

# Acessing notes

while reading between each paragraph you will have multiple options.

just press enter and continue,

enter !new <name> to create a new file for notes (for example you name it after the book),
  
enter !change to change to a different note file when switching books or for notes in a different category,

enter !note <text> to write to the current selected note file. Use !n or \n to create a new line.
  
You can find all your notes in the Data folder. Any notes made before creating a new note file will be stored in DefaultNote.txt

# Enjoy Reading!
