# BookStudy
This is  a terminal application to read online books and articles better since digital reading is harder than analog reading. This program allows you to feed it links and it will write out their text. It also includes some tools to help you write notes and study the texts properly.

# Adding a new book

Either in the opening menu select 1 new book and enter a link. This is experimental and buggy
Or you can open Data and paste your book into CurrentBook.txt and add a 0 in the last line

# Acessing notes

while reading between each paragraph you will have multiple options.

just press enter and continue,

enter !new <name> to create a new file for notes (for example you name it after the book),
  
enter !change to change to a different note file when switching books or for notes in a different category,

enter !note <text> to write to the current selected note file. Use !n or \n to create a new line.
  
You can find all your notes in the Data folder. Any notes made before creating a new note file will be stored in DefaultNote.txt

# Enjoy Reading!
